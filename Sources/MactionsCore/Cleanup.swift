///     job's `_work` checkout, `_tool`/`_actions` caches, `_diag` logs and
///     `.credentials` never accumulate.
///   - Per launch / go-online: `purgeRuns()` plus provider-specific sweeps clear
///     anything a crash or force-quit orphaned last time.
///   - After a successful Windows base rebuild: old `.win11-runner-base.bak.*`
///     rescue copies are removed, reclaiming the multi-GB failed-build backups
///     that `MACTIONS_KEEP_FAILED=1` intentionally preserved for post-mortem.
///   - On demand: `purgeAll()` removes everything Mactions ever wrote to disk
///     (including the cached agent) for a clean uninstall.
